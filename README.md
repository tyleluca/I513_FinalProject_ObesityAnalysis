# I513_FinalProject_ObesityAnalysis
In this project, I employed both logistic regression and artificial neural network classifiers in order to find out which features can best predict if a person is obese.  This repository contains the source data as well as my Jupyter notebook code.
To run this code, download the file and adjust the file reference to the notebook.  Ensure the proper Python libraries are installed.
